Smart, local, open-source load balancing for EV chargers integrated with Home Assistant. Watt-O-Balancer dynamically allocates available service power across one or more EV chargers so multiple vehicles can charge fairly without tripping main breakers or exceeding a configured service limit.

## What it does

The integration watches your home's power meter. When total service power changes, it instantly recalculates how much current your EV charger can safely use without tripping your service limit. If load goes up, charger current goes down — **immediately**. If load goes down, charger current goes back up — after a short cooldown to prevent oscillation.

**How it works — in four steps:**

1. Read total service power from the meter.
2. Subtract the EV's estimated draw to isolate non-EV load: `non_ev_w = service_w − ev_a × V`
3. Calculate available headroom: `available_a = service_limit_a − non_ev_w / V`
4. Set the charger to `min(available_a, charger_max_a)` — reductions are instant, increases wait for a configurable cooldown.

> **Headroom tip:** `service_limit_a` is exactly what you enter in the configuration — it doesn't have to match your physical breaker. Set it lower to leave a permanent safety margin, target a specific subcircuit capacity, or enforce any custom power budget you choose. There is no separate margin setting; you control the limit directly.

**Key features:**
- **Automatic load balancing** — adjusts charger current in real time based on your power meter
- **Safety-first** — reductions are instant; default behavior stops charging if the meter goes offline
- **No YAML required** — configure entirely through the Home Assistant UI
- **Hardware-agnostic** — works with any charger controllable via HA scripts (OCPP, Modbus, REST, etc.)
- **Full observability** — sensors, events, and persistent notifications for monitoring and automations

**Multi-charger support:** Up to `MAX_CHARGERS` EV chargers per power meter (default cap: 3), each with a configurable priority weight (0–100). Available current is distributed proportionally to weights; chargers that are capped or paused redistribute their unused headroom. Priority 0 stops that charger. Existing single-charger configurations continue to work without any migration. See [Multi-charger plan](docs/documentation/milestones/02-2026-02-19-multi-charger-plan.md).

## Quick install (HACS)

1. **Install** via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) — see [Installation & Setup](docs/documentation/installation-and-setup.md)
2. **Configure** in Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → "Watt-O-Balancer"
3. **Create action scripts** to control your charger — see [Action Scripts Guide](docs/documentation/action-scripts-guide.md)
4. **Monitor** via dashboard sensors and [event notifications](docs/documentation/event-notifications-guide.md)

---

## Manual install (developer / local)

1. Copy the `ev_lb` integration folder into `custom_components/ev_lb/` (the current integration domain; a future release may rename this to `watt_o_balancer`).
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Configure via the integration UI.

---

## Example configuration (concept)

Configuration is exposed through the integration UI. Conceptually, you will:
- Select charger entities (EV chargers or smart-plugs)
- Provide a service maximum power limit (W)
- Optional priorities or exclusion lists per charger

---

## Goals

- Keep charging within service limits
- Distribute power fairly across concurrent sessions
- Work locally, with minimal cloud dependency
- Play nice with Home Assistant ecosystems and HACS
